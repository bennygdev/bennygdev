### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Benny Goh and I am currently studying web/app development at the Insitute of Technical Education.
# About this github portfolio
I am working on many future projects, so stay tuned for those uploads :)
I am currently learning front-end/back-end development. I am currently proficient with Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and currently learning how to JavaScript.
I am probably learning C#, SQL, PHP or C++ next year.

# The future of projects
I am currently working on making a website for myself using the skills learnt this year. Hopefully i can implement some back end changes to the website as well.
I have no plans at the moment, but i would like to make a website that lists my portfolio and others later this year, the website uploaded here would be a plain template of it though.

# My stats (soon to be implemented)
