### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**bennygoh1/bennygoh1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
My name is Benny Goh and I am currently studying at the Insitute of Technical Education.
# About this github portfolio
I am working on many projects, so stay tuned for those uploads :)
I am currently learning front-end/back-end development. I am currently proficient with Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and currently learning how to JavaScript.
I am probably learning C#, SQL, PHP or C++ next year. Hyped for that

# The future of projects
I am currently working on making a website for myself using the skills learnt this year. Hopefully i can implement some back end changes to the website as well.
I have no plans at the moment, but i would like to make a website that lists my portfolio and others later this year, the website uploaded here would be a plain template of it though.

# My stats (is this even necessary??)
